This project uses LoRa RFM95 modules operating at 915 MHz.  Both Sender and Receiver modules are described in this project.  The Sender transmits multiple packets of data from a solar panel.  The first packet sends the voltage, current and watts from the panel utilizing a AN219 power monitor sensor.  The next packet sends temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure utilizing a BME280 sensor.  The data is formatted before transmission so the characters for the LoRa receivers 2004 LCD are shown correctly.
